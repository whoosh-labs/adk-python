  A freshly created ``InvocationContext`` has no branch, so a node that
  previously ran on a sub-branch (e.g. a resumed sub-agent, or an agent
  resolved by ``_find_agent_to_run``) would otherwise continue on the root
  branch.

  Tool branches are skipped. A tool's user-facing message is authored under
  the agent's name (``functions.py``) and stamped with the agent's node path
  (``base_agent.py``), so it is indistinguishable from the agent's own turns
  by author or path; what gives it away is its branch, which the same code
  builds as ``<tool>@<function_call_id>`` from a call in this session. Such a
  branch is therefore recognised and skipped, while every other event the node
  authored -- including a plain text turn, which is all a non-resumable
  sub-agent may leave behind -- still carries ``ctx.branch`` and is eligible.
  A branch whose leaf names the node itself is kept even when its id is a
  function call id, since that is how ``AgentTool`` scopes a real sub-agent.

  Nodes are matched by their static path (run ids stripped) so that two nodes
  sharing a name (e.g. the same sub-agent mounted under two parents) are
  disambiguated; events that predate node paths fall back to author/name
  matching. When ``invocation_id`` is provided (resuming a known invocation),
  only that invocation's events are considered, so a resumed node cannot
  inherit a stale branch authored in an earlier invocation. When it is None
  (a fresh direct-node turn, or a new invocation continuing a sub-agent), the
  most recent matching event across the session is used.
