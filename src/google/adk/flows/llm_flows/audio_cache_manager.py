"""Backward compatibility module for AudioCacheManager.

AudioCacheManager and AudioCacheConfig are no longer public; they live in
``google.adk.live._audio_cache_manager`` and this module only keeps
existing imports working. RealtimeCacheEntry is public as
``google.adk.agents.invocation_context.RealtimeCacheEntry``.
