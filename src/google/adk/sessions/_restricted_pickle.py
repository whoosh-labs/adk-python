"""Restricted pickle loading for the legacy v0 session schema.

The v0 session schema stored `EventActions` as a pickled blob. Bytes read back
from the database are untrusted input, so they are loaded through an unpickler
that only resolves the globals needed to reconstruct `EventActions`.

The allowed set is the union of two parts:

* A derived part, computed by walking the Pydantic field annotations of
  `EventActions` (and of `AuthConfig`, which `EventActions` types as `Any` at
  runtime) and admitting every reachable `BaseModel` and `Enum` subclass. Those
  are inert data types: unpickling one only calls `__setstate__` or the enum
  constructor. Deriving them keeps the set correct as the ADK and `google.genai`
  models gain fields, which a hand-written list does not.
* A static part, for globals the walk cannot see: the builtin and stdlib data
  types a `state_delta` holds, which are not Pydantic models, and model
  classes reachable only by subclassing rather than through an annotation.

Anything else - notably arbitrary callables that older versions allowed into
`state_delta` - is refused rather than resolved. See `_RestrictedUnpickler`.

This module exposes `dumps` and `loads`, so it can also be passed directly as
the `pickler` argument of SQLAlchemy's `PickleType`.
