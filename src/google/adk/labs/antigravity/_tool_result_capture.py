"""Buffers the outcome of tool calls, keyed by the call they answer.

A client-side tool's outcome never reaches the trajectory: the terminal
``Step`` for such a call carries an empty ``tool_calls``, and ``Step`` has no
field for a result in the first place. The tool hooks are the one place it
does arrive, so it is captured there and held until ``_event_converter`` can
pair it with its call.

Success and failure arrive on different hooks, and exactly one of them fires
per call: the harness routes a failed tool to ``on_tool_error`` and never to
``post_tool_call`` (``localharness/hook_tool_calls_fragment.go``, "Exactly one
hook fires per step ... They are mutually exclusive"). Hence the two capture
classes below, both feeding one buffer.
