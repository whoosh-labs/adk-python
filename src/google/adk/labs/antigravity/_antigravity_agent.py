"""Runs an Antigravity SDK agent as an ADK agent.

Wraps a pre-configured ``google.antigravity.Agent`` as a native ADK
``BaseAgent`` node, delegating each turn to the Antigravity SDK runner and
streaming the harness's steps back as ADK events.

The harness runs the Antigravity agent's loop and owns its conversation, so an
``AntigravityAgent`` must run as an ADK root agent unless it declares
``mode='single_turn'``. ADK ``sub_agents`` are allowed: each child is bridged
onto the Antigravity SDK config as a client-side tool, which is the only way
the harness can reach one.
