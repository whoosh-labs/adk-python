"""Re-records the telemetry goldens of the functional tests.

Run from the repo root:

    python -m tests.unittests.telemetry.regenerate

Every case is replayed under both inference instrumentations. What ADK's own
instrumentation recorded goes to ``functional_goldens/<scenario>/<test_id>.json``.
Review the resulting diff: it is the telemetry schema change your CL makes,
in the shape users see it.

Where the OTel instrumentor's recording differs, ``functional_divergences.json``
gains an entry -- with an empty ``kind`` and ``reason``, which the tests fail
on until they are filled in. Entries no recording produces any more are
dropped.
