"""Guard tests for the release-cut dependency contract.

These tests pin the public dependency surface so that release-blocking
regressions documented in the bare-install audit cannot silently re-emerge:

* ``packaging`` MUST be declared in main deps (used at import-time by
  ``utils/model_name_utils.py`` and ``cli/cli_deploy.py``; reachable from
  ``from google.adk import Runner`` and from ``adk --help``).
* ``ValidationError`` in ``environment_simulation_config`` MUST come from
  ``pydantic`` (which always installs alongside the package), NOT from the
  undeclared ``pydantic_core``.
* The LangGraph extras MUST exclude the releases that reconstruct unsafe
  objects while deserializing checkpoint data.
* ``google-genai`` MUST exclude 2.11 and floor at 2.12.1 or later, since that
  release is the first whose types module defers the optional MCP server stack
  instead of importing it at Agent startup.
* The ``all`` extra MUST stay the union of every extra that unlocks a runtime
  feature, so that ``pip install "google-adk[all]"`` cannot silently stop
  installing a feature's dependencies.
* Every ``<=`` upper bound MUST name the release the tests run against, so
  that raising one cannot claim support for a release nothing installed.
